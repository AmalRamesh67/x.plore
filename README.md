# Inspiration
Nowadays our world is rushing towards money ;” Money should never become the cornerstone of your life or define you as a person”. Controlling our mind is the most difficult thing. In this era of Covid19, the work from home system and increased usage of online platforms has brought significant rise in mentally stressed people. We found a solution for this problem. The utmost success in our life is to make others happy. In a survey, almost 25 % of the population committed suicides due to mental depression.Saving one life is being in heaven. Moreover, many people lost their jobs and a lot of people owe debts, this adversely affected the mind of peoples, which in turn led to depression. Recent studies, Covid’s mental-health toll, results showed that there was a 30% increase in depressed people. Besides, there is an increase in depressed students. We emphasise how online platforms can keep a mind calm,cool and happy. We consider happiness more than Money. Caring for our dear ones, making them happy and giving them confidence counts more in our life. Most of my friends don’t get any happiness from their own family. Two of our seniors from nearby college attempt suicide.This inspired us to form a idea of forming an app which is truely relevant in our current situation. Our new model is a perfect business model too, since we include talks for our future generation, since awareness about basic life needs is very important.So ,here we make a profit as well as well fare. As students are the future, an immediate resolution is necessary. We introduce you, O’ My Mind!!
